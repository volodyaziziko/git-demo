[Verse 1]
Can hold my breath, only for a little while
'Til reality starts sinking in
Once again, I'm settling for second best
Turn the page and skip to the end
To where I swore that I would try
Since the last time I crossed that line
In the back of my mind, I know

[Chorus]
It only hurts when your eyes are open
Lies get tossed and truth is spoken
It only hurts when that door gets opened
Dreams are lost and hearts are broken

[Verse 2]
Miles away, promise from a burning bed
Two worlds should never collide
One word would end it if you ever heard
Tear the page out that reminds me
When I swore that I'd be strong
Now, the next time has come and gone
Well, maybe I'm wrong, I know

[Chorus]
It only hurts when your eyes are open
Lies get tossed and truth is spoken
It only hurts when that door gets opened
Dreams are lost and hearts are broken

[Bridge]
I know what you're feeling
It's hard to believe in someone
Someone who's not there
I know that you're waiting
'Cause love is worth saving
But only for so long, so long, so long

[Pre-Chorus]
I swore that I would try
Since the last time
The last time

[Chorus]
It only hurts when your eyes are open
Lies get tossed and truth is spoken
It only hurts when that door gets opened
Dreams are lost and hearts are broken

[Chorus]
It only hurts when your eyes are open
Lies get tossed and truth is spoken
It only hurts when that door gets opened
Dreams are lost and hearts are broken
